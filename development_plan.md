My development plan for The Chase is to create a Terminal App that mirrors the TV quiz show "The Chase Australia."

In this app, the user will be the "player" who has to first play a speed round. I will create an array of a bank of 20 or so questions, each in a hash, that will fire randomly at the player, and within 60 seconds each correct answer will award the player with $2000. I will write this round into a separate file to keep the coding process cleaner.

at the end of the speed round,the player will have the choice to face the chaser with their speed round earnings, or face a harder challenge with the prospect of more money or face a simpler challenge with the prospect of less money.

If the player chooses the harder challenge, they will be 5 steps away from winning in another round of quizzing called 'facing the chaser.' If they choose the money they earned, they will be 4 steps away from winning. If they choose the smallest amount of money, they will be three steps away from winning. In the TV show, the Chaser must also guess at the same time. Perhaps if I have the time I will explore adding a function where the computer guesses from a choice of 4. 

In the 'Facing the Chaser' round, the player will be presented with several trivia questions but all answers are multiple choice. There is no longer a time limit. If the player chooses correctly, they descend one step down the ladder towards winning. If they choose incorrectly, the Chaser will sneer at them with their respective personalities.
